### üé® UI / UX

- **Dark Theme by Default:**  
  All UI elements use a consistent dark color scheme using Tailwind classes like `bg-gray-800/900`, `text-gray-100`, etc.

- **Indigo Accent:**  
  Primary CTA buttons and highlights use `indigo` to preserve brand consistency and visual hierarchy.

- **Mobile-Friendly Tables:**  
  All tables are wrapped in `overflow-auto` containers to ensure horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.

- **Smooth Transitions:**  
  Modals use Vue‚Äôs `<transition>` component with `fade` and `scale` effects for smooth appearance and exit animations.

- **Accessibility & Focus:**  
  All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) are keyboard accessible with focus outlines and ring effects.
